# Source status

Round 9 is recovered/regenerated evidence, not restoration of original temporary proof bytes or timings. Round 8 and older source are retained separately. Unrestricted dimension-five bound 94 and the all-dimensional law remain open. Large compressed proof streams remain in the linked original archive and are indexed below with exact hashes.

This is a source-preservation import. Run `python restore_evidence.py` before historical replay: large compressible data are stored losslessly in `_evidence/`, keyed by SHA-256. The original path and hash of each file are recorded in `IMPORT_MANIFEST.json`. Externally retained proof streams must be recovered from their original archive before a replay that needs them. Original manifests remain unchanged.

Fresh checks are recorded in `FRESH_VALIDATION.json`; archived receipts are not fresh verification.

Bulky data, figures and assets are stored in the lossless `_payload/` archive parts. `restore_evidence.py` restores them, verifies each SHA-256, rejoins large objects, then decompresses the original evidence. Native source and status notes remain directly browsable. `PAYLOAD_INDEX.json` records every bundled path.
